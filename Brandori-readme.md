Brandori Marketing Portfolio Platform

Brandori is a web based platform created for marketers to showcase their campaigns in a structured, narrative driven way. Inspired by Behance and Github, Brandori focuses specifically on marketing projects, allowing creators to document the thinking, strategy and outcomes behind their work.

This README outlines the product intent, user experience, system architecture and the value Brandori brings to both jobseekers and hiring managers.

1. Problem Statement

Marketing portfolios are often scattered across PDFs, links and screenshots. Most platforms do not capture the full story behind a campaign. Hirers struggle to assess the strategy, insight and execution quality because the work is not presented in a structured way.

Key gaps:

No standardised format for campaign documentation

Marketers rarely have a space to explain the thinking behind the work

Hiring managers want clarity on decision making and role contribution

Current platforms focus on visual assets rather than strategic depth

Brandori solves this by giving marketers a clean and consistent way to present campaigns just like developers present code or designers present case studies.

2. Product Goals

Create a portfolio platform that showcases both the creative work and the strategic thinking

Allow marketers to document insights, objectives, challenges and results

Provide a profile space that feels professional and recruiter friendly

Enable campaign uploads that follow a simple and repeatable structure

Establish a standard that makes evaluating marketing talent faster and more objective

3. Core Features
Campaign Builder

A guided template that helps users document:

Background and objectives

Insights and strategy

Execution flow

Assets and visuals

Results and learning points

Each section encourages clarity and narrative rather than just visuals.

Clean Personal Profile

Marketers can curate their best work in one link that replaces scattered PDFs or drive folders.

SEO Friendly Campaign Pages

Designed so campaigns can be easily found and indexed when users choose to make them public.

Private and Public Modes

Users can keep campaigns private until they are ready to share.
Perfect for jobseekers who want control over visibility.

Personal Domain Support (Planned Premium Feature)

Brandori aims to let users connect a custom domain so their portfolio can live on their own branded URL.

4. User Experience Design

Brandori is built around simplicity and clarity:

Minimalistic layout

Scannable campaign structure

Typography optimised for readability

Clean visual hierarchy to highlight key thinking

Zero technical skill required for marketers

Every part of the experience supports storytelling and professional presentation.

5. System Overview (Redacted)

Brandori follows a modern web stack with clear separation of frontend, backend and database layers.

Frontend (Next.js on Vercel)
   -> Authentication Layer
   -> Campaign Editor
   -> Personal Profile Pages

Backend (API Layer)

Future planned modules include:

7. Why This Project Matters

Brandori brings together multiple strengths:

Modern web development practices

Insight into how hirers evaluate marketing talent

It creates a standardised way for marketers to communicate their craft, similar to how developers use Github and designers use Behance.
